# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This back end application utilizes an API to manage users, user friends, thoughts, and reactions to those slices through MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. Express.js is used for routing the transactions of data to and from the NoSQL database.

Please note: While the original prompt was to create thoughts and reactions, I have renamed thoughts to slices and reactions to bites. When a user takes a bite out of a slice, it is simply a reaction to another user's thought.

Technologies & Key Concepts:

- Node.js
- NoSQL Database
- RESTful APIs + HTTP Requests

Packages used in this application:

- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
